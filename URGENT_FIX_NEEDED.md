# 🚨 **URGENT: Your App is Still Running Old Code**

## Problem
Your logs show:
```
📡 Service UUID: f43f787b-3b82-4526-b72b-ec38343c18ed  ← RANDOM UUID (OLD CODE)
✅ Service Data added: TEACHER                           ← ADDING SERVICE DATA (OLD CODE)
❌ BLE Advertising failed: ADVERTISE_FAILED_DATA_TOO_LARGE
```

## Expected after fixes:
```
📡 Service UUID: 0000C0DE-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB  ← PREDEFINED UUID (NEW CODE)
✅ Using minimal advertising data (Service UUID only)    ← NO SERVICE DATA (NEW CODE) 
✅ BLE Advertising started successfully!                 ← SUCCESS
```

## 🔧 **Immediate Solution Steps:**

### 1. **Force App Rebuild & Reinstall**
```bash
cd "c:\aditya work\web dev\SIH_HACK\SIH-Hackathon"

# Clean everything
./gradlew clean

# Rebuild 
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Uninstall old app completely
adb -s 10BE7U37Z8000ST uninstall com.hackathon.attendlytics

# Fresh install
adb -s 10BE7U37Z8000ST install app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

### 2. **Alternative: Manual Code Verification**

**Check the SimpleBLEAdvertiser.java file manually:**
- Open: `app/src/main/java/com/hackathon/attendlytics/SimpleBLEAdvertiser.java`  
- Line 80 should be: `this.serviceUUID = UUID.fromString(BLEConfig.SERVICE_UUID);`
- Line 95-97 should NOT have any `addServiceData()` calls
- Look for: `Log.d(TAG, "✅ Using minimal advertising data (Service UUID only)");`

### 3. **Quick Fix: Bypass Service Data Completely**

Add this to TeacherFragment.java line 168:
```java
// BEFORE:
advertiser.setCustomTag("TEACHER"); // Set service data tag

// AFTER:
// advertiser.setCustomTag("TEACHER"); // DISABLED to avoid DATA_TOO_LARGE
Log.d(TAG, "🔧 Skipping service data to avoid size limit");
```

### 4. **Test the Fix**
After rebuilding/reinstalling:
1. **Start attendance session**
2. **Check logs for**: `"0000C0DE-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB"`
3. **Should see**: `"✅ BLE Advertising started successfully!"`
4. **Should NOT see**: Random UUID or "Service Data added"

## 🎯 **Why This Matters**
- **Random UUIDs are too long** for BLE advertising limits
- **Service data** pushes over the 31-byte limit
- **Only the predefined UUID** should be advertised
- **Students scan for the predefined UUID**, not random ones

## 📱 **Emergency Test**
Use **BLE Scanner app** and look for Service UUID: `0000C0DE-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB`

If you still see random UUIDs in the scanner, the fixes haven't taken effect yet.
