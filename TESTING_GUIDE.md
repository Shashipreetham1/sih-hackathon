# üß™ Testing Your Bluetooth Signal Fix

## üìã Step-by-Step Testing Guide

### 1. **Build and Install the Updated App**
```bash
# Clean and rebuild the project
./gradlew clean build

# Install on your test device
./gradlew installDebug
```

### 2. **Test Permission Flow**
1. **Open the app and go to Teacher section**
2. **Click "Start Attendance"** - should see permission request dialog
3. **Grant ALL permissions** (especially BLUETOOTH_ADVERTISE)
4. **Verify logs show**: `"‚úÖ BLUETOOTH_ADVERTISE permission granted"`

### 3. **Verify BLE Advertising is Working**
1. **Check logs for success message**: `"‚úÖ BLE Advertising started successfully!"`
2. **Look for Service UUID in logs**: Your UUID should be displayed
3. **No error logs**: Should not see `"‚ùå BLE Advertising failed"`

### 4. **Test Signal Visibility with External Apps**

#### Option A: Use BLE Scanner Apps
**Download one of these apps on another device:**
- **BLE Scanner** (Nordic Semiconductor) ‚≠ê Recommended
- **nRF Connect for Mobile**
- **Bluetooth LE Scanner**

**Testing steps:**
1. Start attendance on your teacher device
2. Open BLE scanner app on second device
3. Look for devices advertising your Service UUID: `0000C0DE-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB`
4. ‚úÖ **Success**: Your device appears in the scan results
5. ‚ùå **Failure**: No device with your UUID found

#### Option B: Use Your Student App
1. Build and install your app on a second device
2. Go to Student section
3. Scan for BLE devices
4. Should detect the teacher's advertising signal

### 5. **Diagnostic Tools in Your App**
1. **Use BLE Diagnostics Fragment**:
   - Go to Teacher ‚Üí "BLE Diagnostics"
   - Click "Check BLE System"
   - Click "Request Permissions" if needed
   - Look for all green checkmarks ‚úÖ

2. **Check Global BLE Manager**:
   - Verify session is active
   - Check advertising status

### 6. **Debug Logs to Monitor**

#### ‚úÖ **Success Indicators:**
```
‚úÖ BLUETOOTH_ADVERTISE permission granted
‚úÖ BLE Advertising started successfully!
üì° Service UUID: [your-uuid]
üéØ Students should scan for UUID: [your-uuid]
```

#### ‚ùå **Failure Indicators:**
```
‚ùå BLUETOOTH_ADVERTISE permission not granted
‚ùå BLE Advertising failed to start
‚ùå Cannot start advertising - device/Bluetooth not ready
```

### 7. **Common Issues & Solutions**

#### **Issue**: Still no signal visible
**Solutions:**
1. **Restart Bluetooth**: Turn off/on Bluetooth on both devices
2. **Clear app data**: Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí Your App ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí Clear Data
3. **Restart devices**: Sometimes helps with permission caching
4. **Check Android version**: Ensure both devices are Android 5.0+

#### **Issue**: Permission denied repeatedly
**Solutions:**
1. **Manual permission grant**: Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí Your App ‚Üí Permissions ‚Üí Enable all Bluetooth permissions
2. **Check location services**: Must be enabled for BLE scanning on older Android

#### **Issue**: Advertising fails with "TOO_MANY_ADVERTISERS"
**Solutions:**
1. **Stop other BLE apps**: Close other apps that might be advertising
2. **Restart Bluetooth service**: Turn Bluetooth off/on

### 8. **Distance Testing**
1. **Close range** (1-2 meters): Should work reliably
2. **Medium range** (5-10 meters): Should still detect
3. **Long range** (10+ meters): May have intermittent detection

### 9. **Final Verification Checklist**
- [ ] App requests and receives BLUETOOTH_ADVERTISE permission
- [ ] Logs show "BLE Advertising started successfully"
- [ ] External BLE scanner app detects your device
- [ ] Student app can find teacher's signal
- [ ] QR code generates successfully
- [ ] No error messages in logs

## üéØ Expected Results
**Before fixes:** No BLE signal visible, silent permission failures  
**After fixes:** BLE signal clearly visible to other devices, proper permission handling

## üì± Recommended Test Devices
- **Primary**: Physical Android device (not emulator)
- **Secondary**: Another physical device for scanning
- **Android versions**: Test on Android 12+ and older versions

## üîç Troubleshooting Commands
```bash
# View detailed logs
adb logcat -s SimpleBLEAdvertiser BLEAdvertisingManager TeacherFragment

# Check app permissions
adb shell dumpsys package com.hackathon.attendlytics | grep permission

# Clear app data for fresh test
adb shell pm clear com.hackathon.attendlytics
```
