B4:B5:2F:12:34:56
```

**That's it! Just your device's Bluetooth MAC address.**

```

### **⚠️ Error Cases**:
```

## 🏗️ **How It Works**

### **When You Start Attendance:**

1. **App gets your Bluetooth device address** (e.g., `B4:B5:2F:12:34:56`)
2. **Creates QR code with ONLY this address**
3. **Students scan QR code** → Get your exact Bluetooth address
4. **Students search for this address** in their Bluetooth scanner

### **What Students See:**
- **Scan QR code** → Get `B4:B5:2F:12:34:56`  
- **Search for device** with address `B4:B5:2F:12:34:56`
- **Find your device** → Confirm proximity → Mark attendance
